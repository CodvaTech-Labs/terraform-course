# Terraform Workspace EC2 Demo

This Terraform workspace demo is designed to help you manage and deploy infrastructure for different environments (dev, staging, and prod) using Terraform workspaces.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials

## Workspace Setup

To demonstrate the use of Terraform workspaces, we will create infrastructure for three different environments: `dev`, `staging`, and `prod`.

### Dev Environment

1. Create a new Terraform workspace for the `dev` environment:

   ```shell
   terraform workspace new dev
   ```

2. Initialize the Terraform configuration:

   ```shell
   terraform init
   ```

3. Plan the infrastructure:

   ```shell
   terraform plan
   ```

4. Deploy the infrastructure for the `dev` environment:

   ```shell
   terraform apply
   ```

### Staging Environment

1. Create a new Terraform workspace for the `staging` environment:

   ```shell
   terraform workspace new staging
   ```

2. Initialize the Terraform configuration:

   ```shell
   terraform init
   ```

3. Plan the infrastructure:

   ```shell
   terraform plan
   ```

4. Deploy the infrastructure for the `staging` environment:

   ```shell
   terraform apply
   ```

### Prod Environment

1. Create a new Terraform workspace for the `prod` environment:

   ```shell
   terraform workspace new prod
   ```

2. Initialize the Terraform configuration:

   ```shell
   terraform init
   ```

3. Plan the infrastructure:

   ```shell
   terraform plan
   ```

4. Deploy the infrastructure for the `prod` environment:

   ```shell
   terraform apply
   ```

## Managing Workspaces

You can switch between workspaces using the following command:

```shell
terraform workspace select <workspace_name>
```

To see the list of available workspaces, use:

```shell
terraform workspace list
```

## Cleanup

To destroy the resources created in a workspace, use the following command:

```shell
terraform destroy
```

Please note that this demo provides a basic structure for managing environments using Terraform workspaces. You can customize the infrastructure code within the respective environment directories (e.g., `dev/`, `staging/`, `prod/`) to suit your specific requirements.
